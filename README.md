# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Model-using-Logistic-Regression
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in patients using machine learning techniques, specifically logistic regression. Early detection of heart disease can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions and treatment.

Project Overview
Heart disease is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project utilizes logistic regression, a powerful classification algorithm, to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease based on various clinical and demographic features.
